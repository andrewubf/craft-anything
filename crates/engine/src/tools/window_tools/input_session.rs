//! A short scripted session with a program: start it, press keys and click in its window as a
//! script says, picture the window along the way, and close it (ROADMAP R2.4). For games and apps
//! that have no accessibility tree to drive (`runtime_ui_walkthrough_record` covers those that
//! do), so a rebuild can be compared with how the original looks after the same input.
//!
//! Input goes to whichever window is in front, so nothing is sent unless the program's own window
//! is in front, checked again before every key, click and pointer move and while a key is held.
//! When it isn't (the person clicked elsewhere, a dialog opened, the program closed), the session
//! stops there, releases what it holds and says which step it stopped at.

        summary: "Start a program (an app or a game), wait for its window, then play a short script of key presses, typing, pointer moves and clicks into it, taking pictures of its window at the start, at each `picture` step and at the end, and close it (Windows and macOS). Click and move positions are pixels in the window's picture. Input is sent only while the program's own window is in front: if it isn't, the session stops at that step and says why. Pictures are saved as PNGs in `output_dir` when given. It runs the program and takes over the keyboard and mouse for the script's length, so it needs consent; on macOS it also needs Accessibility and Screen Recording permission.",
